**co-express** is an express wrapper that enables generators to be used as middlewares.

## Usage

**co-express** lets you write your express routes by using generator functions as middlewares.
Like this:

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var co = require('co');
var express = require('express');
var wrapper = require('co-express');
var app = wrapper(express());
app.get('/', function* (req, res) {
  var read = co.wrap(fs.readFile);
  var packageContents = yield read('./package.json', 'utf8');
  res.send(packageContents);
});
app.listen(8000);
```

You can also define multiple GeneratorFunctions just the [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) way:
```js
app.get('/users', function* (req, res, next) {
  req.users = yield db.getUsers();
  next();
}, function* (req, res) {
  res.send(req.users);
} );
```

## Installation

    $ npm install co-express
